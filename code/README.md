# The effects of mismatched train and test data cleaning pipelines on regression models: lessons for practice

This folder contains all the code used to perform the experiments in the paper 'The effects of mismatched train and test data cleaning pipelines on regression models: lessons for practice'. The CSV files 'airbnb_raw.csv' and 'uscensus_raw.csv' are from Li et al. (2021) [1]. 'uscensus_raw.csv' was originally from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income. The files 'clean_method.py' and 'cleaner.py' are used to implement different data cleaning setups, and are also based on similar methods as in Li et al.
