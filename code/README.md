# The Effects of Mismatched Train and Test Data Cleaning Pipelines on Regression Models: Lessons for Practice

This folder contains all the code used to perform the experiments in the paper 'The Effects of Mismatched Train and Test Data Cleaning Pipelines on Regression Models: Lessons for Practice'. The two CSV files, 'airbnb_raw.csv' and 'uscensus_raw.csv' are from Li et al. (2021) [1]. The files 'clean_method.py' and 'cleaner.py' are used to implement different data cleaning setups, and are also based on similar methods as in Li et al.
