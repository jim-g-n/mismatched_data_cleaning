This folder contains the analysis material for 'The effects of mismatched train and test data cleaning pipelines on regression models: lessons for practice'. The file 'appendix.pdf' shows the numbering of the different data cleaning pipelines. The main results of all experiments are in the CSV files, which can be easily loaded and analysed using the 'model_results_analysis' notebook. This notebook also includes code to recreate all figures from the paper. The 'cleaning_effects_airbnb' notebook briefly analyses the effects of the cleaning pipelines on distributions in the Airbnb data, as shown in the 'Discussion' section of the paper.
